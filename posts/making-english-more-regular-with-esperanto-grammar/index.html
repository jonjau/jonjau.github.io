        <h1>Making English More Regular With Esperanto Grammar</h1><time>December 27, 2020</time></header><h2 id="some-problems">Some problems</h2>
<p>As a learner of English (who isn&rsquo;t?), I&rsquo;ve come across a lot of inconsistent
rules and exceptions in the language, and I can imagine they exist in most
other natural languages. People just (have to) get used to them. In general:</p>
<ol>
<li>Grammar is complex (13+ tenses!) and verb modification is irregular.</li>
<li>Ambiguous semantics: the same sentence can mean different things.</li>
<li>Spelling does not reflect pronunciation; accents vary wildly.</li>
<li>Vocabulary is vast and borrows from many other languages.</li>
<li>Spoken vs written disconnect: slang, idioms, figures of speech.</li>
</ol>
<p>What can be done to improve it? I&rsquo;m not sure, but there have been
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_English_(version_of_English)">been</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_English">many</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_English_Wikipedia">efforts</a>, mainly
by simplifying sentence structure and restricting vocabulary.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s no changing the way English is spoken in the
mainstream, but ideas are ideas, so here&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>Designing a new language from the ground up is hard, so in any case
vocabulary should be kept constant (if not restricted to simpler words). This
means points 3, 4, 5 are off-limits, there is no way to improve on those
without modifying English words or how they are spelled
(<a href="https://jonjau.github.io/projects/cifero/">related</a>). So, grammar has to
change.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how Esperanto
<a href="https://lernu.net/en/gramatiko">grammar constructs</a> (the few that I know)
might be used to make English and similar languages to be more regular. This
should address point 1 and, to a certain extent, point 2 as well. Specifically,
this post explores that in the context of ambiguity in sentences, which is
apparently
<a href="https://michealaxelsen.com/blog/?p=346">an inherent property of all natural languages</a>.</p>
<h3 id="grammar-simplification">Grammar simplification</h3>
<p>All we&rsquo;re taking from Esperanto are the suffixes and sentence structure.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Suffix</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>-o</td>
<td>noun</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-a</td>
<td>adjective</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-e</td>
<td>adverb</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The immediate problem are the words themselves. Most English words have
meaning baked into their &ldquo;root words&rdquo;, like &lsquo;often&rsquo; or &lsquo;again&rsquo;; modifying
them with suffixes does not make sense (&lsquo;often-e&rsquo; ?) and should be avoided,
but what if someone does it anyway? Exceptions regarding special word forms
will have to remain.</p>
<p>A good practice might be to avoid special words altogether, and stick with
simple verb words. The verb suffix system for Esperanto is
<a href="http://esperanto.davidgsimpson.com/eo-verbforms.html">well-defined</a>:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Suffix</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
<th>Example</th>
<th>Interpretation</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>-as</td>
<td>present</td>
<td>I do-as</td>
<td>I do</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-is</td>
<td>past</td>
<td>I do-is</td>
<td>I did</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-os</td>
<td>future</td>
<td>I do-os</td>
<td>I will do</td>

<tr>
<td>-u</td>
<td>imperative</td>
<td>do-u it-n!</td>
<td>do it!</td>

<td>-us</td>
<td>conditional</td>
<td>I do-us</td>
<td>I would do</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-i</td>
<td>infinitive</td>
<td>do-i it</td>
<td>to do it</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>More complex verb suffixes (maybe unnecessary)</p>
<table>

<h3 id="going-further">Going further</h3>
<p>But what if we wanted to extend verbs such that they could be nouns,
adjectives or adverbs?</p>
<p>Consider <code>'repeat-e'</code>. It means &lsquo;repeat&rsquo;, as an adverb. But how exactly should
it be interpreted?</p>
<ol>
<li>Repetitively</li>
<li>Repeatedly</li>
</ol>
<p>Both are adverbs and they overlap in meaning &ndash; maybe they should not be
different words in the first place. But the rule was to not modify English
words more than necessary. Trying to get at meaning 1 leads to another issue:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>repetition-e</code></li>
<li><code>repetitive-e</code></li>
<li><code>repetitively-e</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Which one is correct? Perhaps all of them, although 3 is redundant. We see
mixing English suffixes and (abused) Esperanto suffixes leads to even more
choice.</p>
<p>So, abusing Esperanto&rsquo;s suffix system, words can become verbs, adjectives or
adverbs, as appropriate. Let&rsquo;s say prepositions (over, on, at), articles (a,
the), conjunctions (and, or) are not changed.</p>
<p>In this system, the words to
which we attach suffixes are the English words, and those words don&rsquo;t have to
be actual root words. It&rsquo;s not always possible and might lead to ambiguity
(e.g. <code>'repeat-e'</code>).</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how the system might be used to disambiguate some sentences:</p>
<h3 id="syntactic-ambiguity">Syntactic ambiguity</h3>
<p>Also known as structural ambiguity or grammatical ambiguity. This is when
the structure of the sentence makes its meaning unclear.</p>
<p>A popular example is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-_" data-lang="_">I saw a man on a hill with a telescope.
</code></pre><p>There are several interpretations:</p>
<ol>
<li>The hill has a telescope.</li>
<li>The man has a telescope.</li>
<li>I used a telescope to see the man.</li>
</ol>
<p>The sentence might be disambiguated by context, or a change in sentence
structure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-_" data-lang="_">1. I saw a man on a hill, which had a telescope.
2. I saw a man, who had a telescope, on a hill.
3. I saw, using a telescope, a man on a hill.
</code></pre><p>If it were &ldquo;I saw a man with a woman with a telescope&rdquo;, disambiguation
would be much more difficult. In speech, emphasis and pauses could be used.</p>
<p>A possible translation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-_" data-lang="_">1. I see-is man-on on have-telescope-a hill-o.
2. I see-is have-telescope-a man-on on hill-o.
3. I use-telescope-e see-is man-on on hill-o.
</code></pre><ul>
<li>the article &lsquo;a&rsquo; is dropped.</li>
<li>-o marks a noun.</li>
<li>-on marks a noun that is the direct object of the verb
(here the man is the object of seeing, &lsquo;so man-on&rsquo;).</li>
<li>-is turns a verb into past tense.</li>
<li>-e marks an adverb.</li>
<li>-a marks an adjective.</li>
</ul>
<p>But using -e and -a to mark adverbial and adjectival clauses is probably not
a good idea, since they might get more complex. What if instead of &lsquo;have
telescope&rsquo; we had &lsquo;had one telescope and now have two&rsquo;? More extensible but
less natural would be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-_" data-lang="_">1. I see-is man-on on hill-o which have-as telescope-on.
2. I see-is man-on who have-as telescope-on on hill-o.
3. I see-is use-ante telescope-on man-on on hill-o.
</code></pre><ul>
<li>-ant- marks continuity, and again, -e makes an adverb so &lsquo;use-ante
telescope-on&rsquo; is an adverbial clause that would describe an action as &lsquo;using
a telescope&rsquo;, in this case the action is &lsquo;seeing&rsquo;.</li>
<li>-as turns a verb into present tense.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lexical-ambiguity-1">Lexical ambiguity 1</h3>
<pre><code class="language-_" data-lang="_">She went to the bank.
</code></pre><p>What bank? Merriam-Webster lists
<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bank">5 entries</a> for &lsquo;bank&rsquo;, but
the sentence structure rules out the verb definitions. Also, the 5th definition
(&lsquo;a group or series of objects arranged together in a row&rsquo;) seems quire rare.
Here &lsquo;bank&rsquo; is either:</p>
<ol>
<li>the bank of a river</li>
<li>the bank to deposit your money in</li>
</ol>
<p>Further context is needed, and often it is available. There is no good way to
deal with this without adding an extra clause.</p>
<pre><code class="language-_" data-lang="_">1. She go-is to the-bank-o of the-river-o.
2. She go-is to the-bank-o for store-i money-o.
</code></pre><ul>
<li>-i makes a verb infinitive: &lsquo;store-i money-o&rsquo; is &lsquo;to store money&rsquo;.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lexical-ambiguity-2">Lexical ambiguity 2</h3>
<pre><code class="language-_" data-lang="_">I like understanding people.
</code></pre><p>This time the sentence structure doesn&rsquo;t help us, and the ambiguity arises
from the fact that &lsquo;understanding&rsquo; can be a verb or an adjective:</p>
<ol>
<li>I like people who are understanding.</li>
<li>I like to understand people.</li>
</ol>
<p>Disambiguation by inventing new English words (this is irregular, and not always
possible):</p>
<pre><code class="language-_" data-lang="_">1. I like understanders.
2. I like people-understanding.
</code></pre><p>Esperanto grammar is particularly well-suited for this. Changing the suffix
changes the role of the word.</p>
<pre><code class="language-_" data-lang="_">1. I like-as understand-ajn person-ojn.
2. I like-as understand-i person-ojn.
</code></pre><p>In the first sentence:</p>
<ul>
<li>-j, pronounced like &lsquo;y&rsquo;, marks plurality: &lsquo;people&rsquo; becomes &lsquo;person-oj&rsquo;, then
it becomes &lsquo;person-ojn&rsquo; because it is the direct object of &lsquo;like&rsquo;.</li>
<li>The adjective &lsquo;understand-a&rsquo; describes &lsquo;person-ojn&rsquo;, so the former follows the
latter&rsquo;s suffixes: &lsquo;understand-ajn&rsquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the second sentence:</p>
<ul>
<li>-i marks an infinitive: &lsquo;understand-i&rsquo; is &lsquo;to understand&rsquo;.</li>
<li>&lsquo;understand-i person-ojn&rsquo; means &lsquo;people-understanding&rsquo; as a noun, it is the
direct object of &lsquo;like&rsquo;, so there is an -n.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="morphological-ambiguity">Morphological ambiguity</h3>
<p>Somewhat related to lexical ambiguity is morphological ambiguity, which (as I
understand) is when adding prefixes and suffixes leads to (further) ambiguity.</p>
<pre><code class="language-_" data-lang="_">This shoe is untieable.
</code></pre><p>Interpretations:</p>
<ol>
<li>This shoe can be untied.</li>
<li>This shoe cannot be tied.</li>
</ol>
<p>With punctuation (different emphasis in speech):</p>
<pre><code class="language-_" data-lang="_">1. This shoe is untie-able.
2. This shoe is un-tieable.
</code></pre><p>With Esperanto grammar:</p>
<pre><code class="language-_" data-lang="_">1. This-shoe-o can-as be-i not-tie-ita.
2. This-shoe-o not-can-as be-i tie-ita.
</code></pre><ul>
<li>not- negates</li>
<li>&lsquo;can&rsquo; is considered a verb</li>
<li>-ita means &lsquo;has been done&rsquo;: &lsquo;tie-ita&rsquo; means &lsquo;tied&rsquo; as in the adjective
(note it ends with -a), e.g. tied shoes.</li>
<li>&lsquo;be-i tie-ita&rsquo; means &lsquo;to be tied&rsquo;</li>
<li>&lsquo;can-as be-i tie-ita&rsquo; means &lsquo;be able to be tied&rsquo;</li>
<li>&lsquo;can-as be-i not-tie-ita&rsquo; means &lsquo;be able to be not tied&rsquo;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-comma-problem">The &ldquo;comma problem&rdquo;</h3>
<pre><code class="language-_" data-lang="_">I invited my parents, Jack and Jill to the party.
</code></pre><p>Interpretations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Two people are invited: my parents who are named Jack and Jill.</li>
<li>Four people are invited: Jack, Jill and my parents.</li>
</ol>
<p>Changing the sentence structure, and punctuation can disambiguate:</p>
<pre><code class="language-_" data-lang="_">1. I invited my parents, Jack, and Jill to the party.
   I invited Jack, Jill, and my parents to the party.

2. I invited my parents (Jack and Jill) to the party.
   I invited to the party, my parents: Jack and Jill.
</code></pre><p>Esperanto grammar (as well as more regular punctuation):</p>
<pre><code class="language-_" data-lang="_">1. I invite-is I-an parent-ojn, Jack-on, and Jill-on to the-party-o.
2. I invite-is I-an parent-ojn who name-as Jack and Jill to the-party-o.
</code></pre><ul>
<li>&lsquo;I&rsquo; becomes &lsquo;my&rsquo; by adding -a.</li>
<li>Since &lsquo;my parents&rsquo; is a direct object we also add -n, so &lsquo;I-an parent-ojn&rsquo;.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not sure if Jack and Jill need -o&rsquo;s in the second sentence.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-it-problem">The &ldquo;it problem&rdquo;</h3>
<pre><code class="language-_" data-lang="_">The dog furiously chased the cat until it suddenly fell.
</code></pre><p>What is &lsquo;it&rsquo; referring to?</p>
<ol>
<li>The dog chased the cat until the cat fell.</li>
<li>The dog chased the cat until the dog fell.</li>
</ol>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think of a way to disambiguate this while keeping the &lsquo;it&rsquo;.</p>
<pre><code class="language-_" data-lang="_">1. The-dog-o fury-e chase-is the-cat-on until the-cat-o sudden-e fall-is.
2. The-dog-o fury-e chase-is the-cat-on until the-dog-o sudden-e fall-is.

With slight alterations:</p>
<pre><code class="language-_" data-lang="_">English grammar is complex, making it difficult to remember, master and use
logically. Ensuring you use the correct grammar can be tricky, especially
when you are in conversation with someone and they are speaking at an
alarmingly fast pace. Learning grammar is like learning to drive, you can
learn all of the theory, rules and regulations, but you won't be good at it
unless you practice it and it starts to become second nature to you. Grammar
is extremely important, incorrect use of grammar can confuse the person you
are speaking to and even change the meaning of what you are communicating,
what's more is native English speakers are hyper-aware of grammar and will
notice almost immediately if a grammatical error is made, even if this is the
smallest of errors. Don't get me started on accents...
</code></pre><p>Esperanto grammar (kind of):</p>
<pre><code class="language-_" data-lang="_">English-a grammar-o be-as complex-a, such-that difficult-as remember-i,

</code></pre><p>Most of this is probably inaccurate, but it is interesting still.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Clearly, mixing Esperanto grammar and English vocabulary leads to language
that is unpleasant and difficult to read, speak, write or listen to. I would
say this is mostly due to the heavy use of &lsquo;-&rsquo; (maybe apostrophes would have
been better) and the difference in the pronunciation systems.
Perhaps a system similar to this may be useful in informal human-readable
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging">speech tagging</a>, to
disambiguate speech, or more generally, further separate
grammar from vocabulary (unlikely).</p>
